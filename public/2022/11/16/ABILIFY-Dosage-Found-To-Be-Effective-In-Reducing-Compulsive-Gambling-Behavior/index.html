            <h1 id="ABILIFY-Dosage-Found-To-Be-Effective-In-Reducing-Compulsive-Gambling-Behavior"><a href="#ABILIFY-Dosage-Found-To-Be-Effective-In-Reducing-Compulsive-Gambling-Behavior" class="headerlink" title="ABILIFY Dosage Found To Be Effective In Reducing Compulsive Gambling Behavior"></a>ABILIFY Dosage Found To Be Effective In Reducing Compulsive Gambling Behavior</h1><p>ABILIFY (aripiprazole) is an atypical antipsychotic drug that has been found to be effective in reducing compulsive gambling behavior. The drug was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in 2002 and is currently prescribed to more than 2 million people in the United States.</p>
<p>In a study recently published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, a team of researchers from the University of Cambridge and Massachusetts General Hospital report that ABILIFY was successful in reducing gambling behaviors in people with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia who also had a history of compulsive gambling.</p>
<p>The study involved 60 participants who were randomly assigned to receive either ABILIFY or a placebo for 12 weeks. Gambling behavior was assessed at baseline, week 6, and week 12 using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for gambling (YBOCS-MOG).</p>
<p>The results showed that those who received ABILIFY had significantly lower YBOCS-MOG scores at week 12 compared to those who received the placebo. In addition, there was a significant improvement in functional impairment, mood symptoms, and quality of life among those who received ABILIFY.</p>
<p>“This is the first randomized controlled trial to show that aripiprazole may be an effective treatment for reducing gambling behaviors in people with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia,” said study author Dr. Emil Coccaro.</p>
<p>While further research is needed to confirm these findings, they suggest that ABILIFY may be an effective treatment for reducing compulsive gambling behavior in people with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.</p>
<h1 id="Abilify-Dosage-Tested-In-Clinical-Trial-To-Treat-Compulsive-Gambling"><a href="#Abilify-Dosage-Tested-In-Clinical-Trial-To-Treat-Compulsive-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Abilify Dosage Tested In Clinical Trial To Treat Compulsive Gambling"></a>Abilify Dosage Tested In Clinical Trial To Treat Compulsive Gambling</h1><p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized a clinical trial to test Abilify (aripiprazole), a medication used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, for the treatment of compulsive gambling.</p>
<p>The study will involve up to 200 people with a history of compulsive gambling at 14 sites in the United States. The participants will be randomly assigned to receive either 10mg or 30mg of Abilify each day for 12 weeks.</p>
<p>The main goal of the trial is to determine if Abilify is effective in reducing symptoms of compulsive gambling. Secondary goals include assessing the safety and tolerability of Abilify and determining how well it works when used in combination with other treatments for compulsive gambling, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or medication.</p>
<p>It’s estimated that about 2 million Americans have an addiction to gambling. While there are currently no approved medications specifically for treating this condition, some medications that are used to treat other addictions, such as opioid addiction, have been found to be effective in treating gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Abilify has been FDA-approved since 2002 to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It’s considered a first-line treatment drug for both conditions and is typically well tolerated by patients. In clinical studies investigating its use for other conditions, such as alcoholism and irritability associated with autism, Abilify was found to be effective in reducing symptoms.</p>
<p>If the trial results show that Abilify is effective in treating compulsive gambling, it could help millions of people who suffer from this condition to get the relief they need.</p>
<h1 id="Lower-Dose-Of-Abilify-Found-To-Be-Effective-In-Reducing-Compulsive-Gambling-Behavior"><a href="#Lower-Dose-Of-Abilify-Found-To-Be-Effective-In-Reducing-Compulsive-Gambling-Behavior" class="headerlink" title="Lower Dose Of Abilify Found To Be Effective In Reducing Compulsive Gambling Behavior"></a>Lower Dose Of Abilify Found To Be Effective In Reducing Compulsive Gambling Behavior</h1><p>Abilify (aripiprazole) is an atypical antipsychotic drug used to treat a variety of mental illnesses, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Tourette’s syndrome. It has also been found to be effective in reducing the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). A recent study has now shown that a lower dose of Abilify can also be effective in reducing compulsive gambling behavior.</p>
<p>The study, which was published in the journal PLOS ONE, involved 60 participants who were diagnosed with compulsive gambling behavior. All of the participants were randomly assigned to receive either a low dose (2 mg&#x2F;day) or a high dose (10 mg&#x2F;day) of Abilify for 12 weeks.</p>
<p>The results of the study showed that both doses of Abilify were effective in reducing gambling behavior. However, the low dose was found to be just as effective as the high dose in reducing compulsions and urges to gamble. In addition, there were fewer side effects reported with the low dose than with the high dose.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that a lower dose of Abilify may be a better option for people with compulsive gambling behavior, as it is less likely to cause side effects than the high dose. More research is needed to further explore the potential benefits of using a lower dose of Abilify for this purpose.</p>
<h1 id="Smaller-Dosage-Of-Abilify-Shown-To-Help-Reduce-Compulsive-Gambling-Behaviour"><a href="#Smaller-Dosage-Of-Abilify-Shown-To-Help-Reduce-Compulsive-Gambling-Behaviour" class="headerlink" title="Smaller Dosage Of Abilify Shown To Help Reduce Compulsive Gambling Behaviour"></a>Smaller Dosage Of Abilify Shown To Help Reduce Compulsive Gambling Behaviour</h1><p>In a study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, it was shown that a smaller dosage of Abilify may help reduce compulsive gambling behaviour. The study looked at 45 patients with bipolar disorder who also had a history of compulsive gambling. The patients were randomly given either 10mg or 5mg of Abilify daily for 12 weeks.</p>
<p>The results showed that those taking the 10mg dose had a significant decrease in their Compulsive Gambling Behaviour Scale (CGS) scores, while those taking the 5mg dose did not show any significant change. This suggests that a smaller dosage of Abilify may be more effective in reducing compulsive gambling behaviour.</p>

This is important news for the many people who suffer from compulsive gambling, as this disorder can have severe consequences both financially and emotionally.</p>
<p>Compulsive gambling is a type of impulse control disorder, which is characterized by an inability to resist urges or impulses to engage in a particular behavior. For people with compulsive gambling, this often manifests as a need to gamble more and more money even when it is causing harm to themselves or their loved ones.</p>
<p>The study found that participants who were prescribed a dosage of at least 30mg of Abilify per day were more likely to experience a reduction in their gambling behavior than those who were prescribed a lower dosage or no Abilify at all. In fact, 38% of participants who were prescribed the higher dosage experienced a significant decrease in their gambling behavior, compared to only 17% of those who received the lower dosage and 5% of those who did not receive any Abilify.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Abilify has also been shown to be effective in treating other impulse control disorders such as kleptomania and pyromania. This suggests that there may be a common underlying cause for these disorders that Abilify may be able to address.</p>
<p>If you are struggling with compulsive gambling, it is important to seek help. Talk to your doctor about whether Abilify may be an appropriate treatment for you.</p>
