#  What is FC Barcelona?

FC Barcelona, also known as Barça, is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. The club was formed in 1899 by Joan Gamper and has become one of the most successful clubs in Europe.

Barcelona is the second most valuable sports team in the world, worth $4 billion as of 2019, and the world's fourth most valuable football team worth €3.1 billion. The club has won more than a hundred official trophies, including La Liga and the UEFA Champions League.

The team is also noted for its attacking style of play, with Lionel Messi being regarded as one of the greatest players of all time.

# Origins

FC Barcelona was founded on November 29th, 1899 by Swiss businessman Joan Gamper and his friend August Urgelés. Gamper had moved to Barcelona in 1888 at the age of 21 and soon became involved with local football clubs. He unsuccessfully attempted to create his own club twice before finally succeeding with Barcelona.

Urgelés was president of Club Español de Football (CEF), which was heavily opposed to Catalan nationalism. As a result, Gamper decided to form a new club alongside Urgelés that would represent Catalonia and be open to players from all over Spain. However, this new club would still remain loyal to CEF.

On December 14th, 1899, FC Barcelona played its first-ever match against English side Foot-Ball Club Skye in Montjuïc Stadium. The game ended in a 2-2 draw. The following year, Barça won its first trophy after defeating Bizcaya 3-1 in the Copa del Rey final.

A little over one year ago, on January 1st, 2017, Pokemon GO was released in North America. The app had been downloaded more than 500 million times by July 2017, and as of September 2017, it has been installed on more than 7.5 billion devices. What made this app so popular?

Niantic Labs, the developer of Pokemon GO, tapped into people’s nostalgia for the original Pokemon games released on the Nintendo Gameboy 20 years ago. But that’s not all – they also incorporated augmented reality features that allowed players to catch pokemon in the real world. The game became an instant hit, with people spending hours outside trying to catch ‘em all.

What can businesses learn from the success of Pokemon GO? First and foremost, nostalgia is a powerful motivator – businesses should tap into customers’ fond memories of past experiences to create new products or services. Secondly, augmented reality is a powerful tool that can be used to increase customer engagement. Finally, businesses should focus on creating addictive gameplay mechanics that keep customers coming back for more.
