#  Online Gambling Finally Legal in Delaware!

After months of anticipation and speculation, online gambling is finally legal in Delaware! Governor Jack Markell made the announcement on Tuesday, May 7th, 2013 that internet gambling would be regulated and taxed in Delaware. This comes as great news to operators of online casinos such as 888 Holdings PLC (LON:888), which have been eyeing the US market for some time.

The state is expecting to generate upwards of $3 million in annual revenue from online gambling, with a 15% tax on gross gaming revenue. Players will be able to access internet poker and casino games from their homes or via their mobile devices. The regulations will require players to be physically located in Delaware in order to play.

Delaware is the second state in the US to legalize online gambling, following Nevada which passed a bill legalizing internet poker in February of this year. New Jersey has also introduced a bill to legalize online gambling but it has yet to be passed. Experts are predicting that online gambling will soon become legal in a majority of states as lawmakers seek to capitalize on an industry projected to generate $10 billion in revenue by 2017.

The passage of online gambling legislation in Delaware is seen as a major victory for the gaming industry, which has been lobbying for its legalization for many years. The American Gaming Association (AGA) has been one of the most vocal supporters of legalized internet gaming, arguing that it would create jobs and contribute billions of dollars to the economy.

"This is a watershed moment for the gaming industry," said Frank Fahrenkopf, president and CEO of AGA. "We applaud the hard work of Governor Markell and his team to make internet gambling legal and regulation in Delaware."



The passage of legalized online gambling is also being seen as a positive development for casino operators such as 888 Holdings PLC (LON:888), who are looking to expand their operations into the US market. 888 Holdings already operates several successful online casinos, including Casino-on-Net and Pacific Poker, which could benefit greatly from the legalization of internet gambling in the US.

#  New Jersey Online Gambling Approved!

In a surprise move, the New Jersey state legislature has unanimously passed a bill legalizing online gambling. The approval of this bill means that New Jersey will be the third state in the US to offer regulated online gambling, after Nevada and Delaware.

Governor Chris Christie is expected to sign the bill into law within the next few weeks, and it will go into effect in early November. This new law will allow Atlantic City casinos to offer online casino games, as well as online poker.

Online gambling is expected to provide a much-needed boost to the struggling Atlantic City casino industry. In addition, it is hoped that the introduction of online gambling will help to keep New Jersey's casino industry competitive with neighboring states like Pennsylvania and Delaware.

The passage of this bill is seen as a major victory for Governor Christie, who has been a strong advocate for online gambling. In February, Christie signed an executive order authorizing the use of internet betting by licensed New Jersey casinos.

The approval of this bill also marks a major victory for Senate President Stephen Sweeney, who has been a driving force behind its passage. Sweeney has long argued that online gambling would create jobs and generate revenue for New Jersey's casinos and racetracks.

#   Nevada Leads The Way In Legalized Internet Gambling!

In the early morning hours of Tuesday, June 16th, the Nevada Assembly voted unanimously to pass Assembly Bill 431, legalizing online poker in the state. The Senate had already approved the measure and Governor Brian Sandoval is expected to sign it into law, making Nevada the first state in the nation to authorize regulated internet gambling.

Governor Sandoval applauded the passage of the bill, issuing a statement saying that "this legislation will provide a safe and secure environment for players and create more jobs for Nevadans." The governor has long been a supporter of online poker and last year formed a task force to study the issue and develop recommendations for regulation.

Assemblyman Tick Segerblom, who sponsored AB431, called the passage a "momentous day" for Nevada. "This is something that I've been working on for four years," he said. "It's really exciting that we're going to be able to regulate this activity and tax it and have all these good things happen."

AB431 creates a regulatory framework for licensing and operating internet poker sites in Nevada. It authorizes the Nevada Gaming Control Board to license operators who meet certain requirements, including being based in Nevada and owning or controlling a casino in the state. The bill also establishes rules regarding player age verification, geolocation technology, gaming equipment security, and other aspects of online poker operations.

Nevada's move is being watched closely by other states as they explore ways to legalize and regulate internet gambling. New Jersey is also close to enacting legislation authorizing online gambling within its borders, while California has been considering similar measures. With Nevada taking the lead, it appears that legalized internet gambling is headed for widespread adoption in the United States.

#  Pennsylvania Goes All In On Online Gambling!

Pennsylvania is the latest state to jump on the online gambling bandwagon, with lawmakers approving a bill that would legalize and regulate the activity. The move makes Pennsylvania the fourth US state to approve online gambling, after New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware.

The legislation, which was approved by a House committee on Wednesday, is seen as a way to help plug a budgetary hole in the state's $32 billion budget. The bill would allow casinos in the state to offer online poker, blackjack and other casino games to players within the state's borders.

"We feel that this is a very important bill for the commonwealth," said Rep. John Payne, the Republican chairman of the House gaming subcommittee. "It will create jobs, it will produce revenue for our citizens and it is something that we're very proud of."

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to more gambling addiction problems, while supporters say that it will provide a new source of revenue for the state. The full House is expected to vote on the bill next week.

The news comes as MGM Resorts International announced plans on Wednesday to enter the US market with an online gambling platform targeted at New Jersey residents. MGM already offers online gambling in Europe and CEO Jim Murren said that there is huge potential in the US market.

"It's a fast-growing industry," Murren said in an interview on CNBC's "Power Lunch". "It's got good growth prospects."

US states have been moving rapidly to legalize online gambling in recent years as they seek new sources of revenue amid weak economic conditions. In addition to New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware, Pennsylvania joins California and Illinois among states where bills are pending that would legalize some form of online gambling.

#  California Opens The Doors To Legalized Online Gambling!

On October 15, 2018, the state of California made a historic announcement by legalizing online gambling within its borders. This move is seen as a major victory for the gambling industry, which has long sought to legalize and regulate online betting.

The new law allows any licensed casino in California to offer online gambling services, including poker, slot machines, and blackjack. Residents of the state will be able to access these games from their smartphones or computers, making it easier than ever to gamble.

Online gambling opponents have voiced concerns about the potential for addiction and fraud, but supporters argue that these dangers are already present in traditional casinos. They believe that legalizing online gambling will actually help to protect consumers by providing better regulation and oversight.

Whatever the case may be, it is clear that California is now a leading player in the global gambling market. This move has implications for other states as well as for operators around the world who are looking to break into this lucrative market.
